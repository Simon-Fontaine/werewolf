# 🎯 Project Overview

This is a real-time multiplayer web implementation of the classic social deduction game Werewolf (also known as Mafia). The project aims to create a scalable, production-ready application that supports multiple concurrent game rooms with advanced role mechanics, real-time communication, and a polished user experience.

## Core Vision

- **Social Gaming Platform**: Enable players worldwide to enjoy Werewolf games with friends or through matchmaking
- **Rich Role System**: Implement 17+ unique roles with complex interactions and special abilities
- **Real-Time Experience**: Seamless gameplay with instant updates, live chat, and synchronized game states
- **Accessibility**: Support both casual guests and registered users with progression systems

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

### Current Implementation (Backend - Completed)

#### **Core Technologies**

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Web Framework**: Fastify (chosen for 2-5x performance over Express)
- **Real-Time**: Socket.IO for WebSocket communication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (persistent data) + Redis (cache & pub/sub)
- **ORM**: Prisma with full TypeScript integration
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT implementation with refresh tokens
- **Monorepo**: Organized workspace structure with shared types

#### **Key Architectural Decisions**

1. **Hybrid Database Approach**: PostgreSQL for ACID-compliant persistent storage (users, game history), Redis for ephemeral high-frequency data (active games, chat)
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Socket.IO rooms for game sessions with Redis pub/sub for cross-server communication
3. **Custom Auth over Supabase**: Implemented in-house JWT solution for full control and self-hosting capabilities
4. **Server-Authoritative Design**: All game logic validated server-side to prevent cheating

### Performance Characteristics

- Supports 8,000-15,000 concurrent WebSocket connections
- Handles 800-1,500 concurrent games (8-12 players each)
- Sub-3ms latency for real-time updates
- Optimized for single VPS deployment with clear horizontal scaling path

## 🎮 Game Implementation

### Implemented Features

#### **Role System** (17 Roles Across 3 Teams)

- **Werewolves Team**: Werewolf, Black Wolf (can convert), Wolf Riding Hood (vote protection)
- **Solo Team**: White Wolf (kills everyone), Mercenary (Day 1 assassination contract)
- **Villagers Team**: 12 roles including Seer, Witch, Hunter, Guard, Cupid, Dictator, and unique Riding Hood variants

#### **Game Flow**

1. **Lobby System**: Public/private rooms with access codes
2. **Role Assignment**: Balanced distribution based on player count
3. **Phase Management**: Automated transitions between Night → Day → Voting phases
4. **Action Resolution**: Priority-based processing of night abilities
5. **Win Condition Checking**: Complex victory scenarios including Cupid lovers

#### **Advanced Mechanics**

- **Death Triggers**: Hunter revenge, Cupid lover chains, role inheritance
- **Protection Systems**: Guard shields, Riding Hood immunities
- **Special Abilities**: Witch potions, Dictator coups, White Wolf devours
- **First Night Actions**: Cupid linking, Heir selection

## 📦 Database Schema

### Core Models

- **User**: Supports guests, registered, and premium accounts
- **Game**: Comprehensive state tracking with phase timers
- **Player**: Role assignments, abilities, and death tracking
- **GameAction**: Audit trail of all player actions
- **Ability**: Dynamic ability system with usage tracking
- **Chat**: Multi-channel messaging (all, werewolves, dead, spectators)

### Real-Time State Management

- Redis caching for active game states
- Pub/sub for broadcasting game events
- Automatic reconnection handling with 60-second grace period

## 🚧 Current Status

### ✅ Completed (Backend)

- [x] Complete authentication system with JWT + refresh tokens
- [x] Game creation, joining, and lobby management
- [x] All 17 roles with unique abilities implemented
- [x] Real-time phase transitions and timers
- [x] Complex action resolution and death triggers
- [x] Multi-channel chat with role-based access
- [x] Friend system and user statistics
- [x] Matchmaking queue with skill ratings

### 🔄 In Progress

- [ ] Frontend development (not started)
- [ ] Testing suite for game logic
- [ ] Admin tools and moderation

### 📋 TODO - Frontend Development

#### **Technology Stack** (Planned)

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for game state
- **Real-Time**: Socket.IO client
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or similar
- **Build Tool**: Vite

#### **Core Features to Implement**

1. **Authentication Flow**

   - Guest quick-play
   - Registration/login forms
   - Token refresh handling

2. **Game Lobby**

   - Browse public games
   - Create game with settings
   - Join via code
   - Player ready states

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Current Architecture

- Single VPS deployment capable
- Docker Compose orchestration
- PM2 for process management
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start all services
npm run dev:backend      # Backend only
npm run dev:database     # Prisma studio

# Database
npm run db:migrate -w @werewolf/database
npm run db:push -w @werewolf/database

# Production
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Environment Setup

Required environment variables:

- Database: `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`
- Auth: `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECRET`
- App: `PORT`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `NODE_ENV`

## 📚 Key Design Decisions

1. **Why Fastify over Express?**: 2-5x performance improvement crucial for real-time gaming
2. **Why not Supabase Auth?**: Need full control for custom game-specific auth flows
3. **Why Redis + PostgreSQL?**: Optimal balance of persistence and performance
4. **Why Socket.IO over raw WebSockets?**: Built-in rooms, reconnection, and fallbacks
5. **Why Monorepo?**: Shared types between frontend/backend prevent API mismatches

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. Supports 100+ concurrent games smoothly
2. <100ms action latency for good connections
3. Mobile and desktop players can play together seamlessly
4. Players return regularly (>5% Day 30 retention)
5. Positive community feedback on gameplay experience
